job recommendation system 

Abstract : 
This End of Year Project aims to design and develop an innovative job
recommendation system to facilitate the match between candidates and job openings. The
process commenced with an in depth analysis of needs, encompassing the collection of
requirements and clear definition of the pr oject scope in close collaboration with prospective
users. Following a validated design phase with stakeholders, we adopted an agile approach for
implementation, fostering continuous client involvement throughout the development
process.
